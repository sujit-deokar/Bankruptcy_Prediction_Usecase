# Bankruptcy_Prediction_Usecase

## Motivation

1. Effective bankruptcy prediction is critical for financial institutions to make appropriate lending decisions.
2. Bankruptcy or business failure can have a negative impact both on the enterprise itself and the global economy. 
3. Several recent studies have found that corporate governance indicators (CGIs) and Financial Ratios play a key role in predicting bankruptcy. 
4. Financial Ratios can be classified into seven categories: solvency, profitability, cash flow ratios, capital structure ratios, turnover ratios, growth, and others
5. CGIs can be classified into five categories: board structure, ownership structure, cash flow, key person retained, and others. However, only some of the CGIs have been considered in these works to prove that model performance improvement can be obtained with them.
